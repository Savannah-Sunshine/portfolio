- Developed a JavaScript-based chatbot using Twilio and EC2, capable of persistent conversations and sales- oriented responses.
- Engineered prompts and memory handling for effective, human-like interactions and lead conversion.

I just wanted a place to showcase some cool projects I worked on. 

#### Languages:
Written primarily in Javascript, it also contains some cool MDX files speed up website load times.
